Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

This script assumes that you have a Dockerfile in the same directory as the script, and it specifies how to build the Docker image. After building the image, it runs a container based on that image, exposing port 5000 of the container to port 5000 of the host system.

To use the script:

Save the script into a file named run.sh.
Make sure the Dockerfile and Flask app (app.py) are in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing run.sh, and run chmod +x run.sh to make the script executable.
Run the script using ./run.sh.
After running the script, the Flask app will be containerized and accessible at http://localhost:5000.
